# My Hero Academia Anime Quiz


## Description

- This quiz was designed to put your Anime knowledge to the test, it also served to practice everything I have learned so far during bootcamp.

- It was designed with one Anime material in specific being it the Anime "My Hero Academia" for a fun theme that could keep me working on the little details.

- My main focus during this project was to have a functional yet compact site that could be loaded quickly.
